# Mask-R-CNN-Object-Detection
Mask R-CNN is an object detection model based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) developed by a group of Facebook AI researchers in 2017. The model can return both the bounding box and a mask for each detected object in an image.

# Mask R-CNN :
Mask R-CNN is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and state-of-the-art in terms of image segmentation. This variant of a Deep Neural Network detects objects in an image and generates a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance.
